title: Community Bonding
---
 
During the Community Bonding period, I was asked to check the relevant works
done previously in Brian as well as by others. Among which, `nmlexport` package
was the most relevant to refer and familiarizing it was very crucial. The main
reason for that is my project proposal as well as
[nmlexport package](https://brian2tools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/brian2tools.nmlexport.html) have a lot of things and
intuitions in common, as they both aim to describe Brian models in some standard representation.
I was also asked to look at [ANNarchy](https://annarchy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) report feature
to represent models in [Nordlie et al. format](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000456).

The most important thing to finalize within Community Bonding was exploring representation or markup language
to represent the proposed model descriptions. We checked [NeruoML Lite](https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroMLlite),
```dict```, ```XML``` and ```JSON``` based representation and finally decided to use dictionary representation. The main intuition
was, it is flexible at the same time easy to access and use as well. With this conceptualization and familiarization, 
I was all set ready to start coding bammm!
 
The community bonding was really awesome, it helped me to get prepared and set to make my tiny contribution to be useful
to the organization. My mentor and I, also decided to keep Wednesday as the official weekly video meeting day apart from daily
```Gitter``` and ```GitHub``` conversations for doubt clarifications and suggestions. The Community bonding period improved the
quality of communication between me and my mentor, and made to get to know about each other.
