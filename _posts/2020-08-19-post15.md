title: Week 13 report (August 19 to August 25)
---

Reaching the last week, I was more biased on the idea my mentor gave that having markdown description 
for all [Brian exmaples listed in doc](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/)
would be really cool and that would showcase the quality and potential use of the work done.

So, I created [repository of exmaples](https://github.com/Vigneswaran-Chandrasekaran/Brian2-examples-markdown-descriptions)
from Brian doc and created markdown description for them. 
It came out real nice and was very happy about that! and the last week was more on documenting stuffs and finishing this blog
before deadline.

And yeah! that is the last week of my GSoC (with mixture of happiness and sadness)
