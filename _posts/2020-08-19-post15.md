title: Week 13 report (August 19 to August 25)

Reaching the last week, I felt having markdown export for all [Brian exmaples listed in doc](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/)
would be really cool and shows the potential use of the work done (this idea was given by my mentor).
So, I created [repository of exmaples](https://github.com/Vigneswaran-Chandrasekaran/Brian2-examples-markdown-descriptions)
from Brian doc and created markdown description for them. It came out real nice and was
very happy about that!
