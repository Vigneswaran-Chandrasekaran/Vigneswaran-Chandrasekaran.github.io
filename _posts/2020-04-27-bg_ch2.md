 - Prologue - A series on Srimad Bhagavad Gita 

'Bhagavad Geeta' translated as "the Song of the God", is considered to be one of the most 
enthralling gift, that human kind had ever received.

It had broken the bounds made by religion,
region, language, caste, creed etc. (you name it.) and magnetized the readers with its aphorism. 
Nonetheless, it consists of verses that the God himself said by using his own Broca's area 
(incarnated in human form with sweet human name: Sri Krishna). However it doesn't really confine to
and label a particular religion or community. Interestingly, this is not me saying like that, it 
is told by no other than the Supreme God himself in Bhagavad Geeta with a beautiful sloka (verse) as,

    `सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज । 
     अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः ॥`

    `sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja 
     aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah `

    Meaning: Abandon all varieties of religion and 
    just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from 
    all sinful reaction. Do not fear.

Bhagavad Geeta had witnessed so many notes and explainatory works by a plethora extremely reverent 
scholars. So me writing about it is no where different from pointing flashlight and expecting it to
be an alternative to the very sun. I would say Bhavad Geeta was intended to witness/feel the sweetness of God's unquantifiable
mercy and purest love towards us, which unfortunately forgotten by the humankind but instead worshiping or having faith 
in the almighty is considered to be being less-rational or un-scientific. God is not unfathomable but is as
pure and simple as: the love which is shown by the Mother, the faith whic we have on our body on digesting the food we eat, 
the truth which gives ultimate peace, the science which synchronously governs the system, the empirical data which 
is consistent with theorotical .. It is worth to mention the story behind how veterent saint, Swami Vivekananda became
the disciple of RamaKrishna Paramahamsa. During his fledgling young age Vivekananda became very eager to find a right 
teacher to understand the ultimate truth, so he meander across the places and floundered the so-called religious teachers,
with a simple question of "Have you seen the God ?". Unsurprisingly everyone got furious and snubbed him away, until he 
met Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who after listening to this enthusiastic young boy's question, replied back gently saying,
"Ofcourse, I have seen the God, same like how I am seeing you!" and explained how God should be felt as how honey is 
felt for its sweetness. Undoubtedly, Bhagavad Geeta is a collection of lucid and elegant thoughts of the God, told by 
him to understand him and lead a life at its best. The famous Bhaja Govindam feits Bhagavad Gita by,

    `भगवद्गीता किञ्चिदधीता
     गङ्गाजललवकणिका पीता ।
     सकृदपि येन मुरारिसमर्चा
     क्रियते तस्य यमेन न चर्चा ॥ २०॥ `

    `bhagavadgītā kiñcidadhītā
     gaṅgājalalavakaṇikā pītā ।
     sakṛdapi yena murārisamarcā
     kriyate tasya yamena na carcā ॥ 20॥ `

    Meaning: Let a man read but a little from 
    Bhagavad Gita, drink just a drop of water 
    from the Ganges, worship but once the God. 
    He then will have no altercation by his death.
