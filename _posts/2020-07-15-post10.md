This week, I was all excited and got into an artistic mood xD

I worked on creating functions to return markdown strings by expanding the details of Brian objects
defined in the run level. With that week we paused on this work. Moreover, conceptualizing it to represent
a standard way was not clear without supporting `Synapses` (the main component) in
`baseexport`. Also, the goal of human readable export is to represent model details but at the same time
flexible enough to make edit to the structure/words, and way to handle that was not super clear that time.
So we moved on to supporting `Synapses`, which is not as straightforward as
other components and without supporting them, the project will not look complete.

Also, the unit functions for markdown can also be easily used after finishing `Synapses` work.
