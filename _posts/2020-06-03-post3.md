The first week on Coding season and with all excitement, I started my work by writing a function
that would get a `NeuronGroup` object and spit out dictionary of basic details about it. The details
like name, population size were low hanging fruits to get but representing `Equations` and bringing in
structure was a bit involving and moreover it is one of the most important entity in Brian.
And proceeding with next steps, other important details like, `Events` and `identifiers` are taken in
account ([Gist link for function](https://gist.github.com/Vigneswaran-Chandrasekaran/0b72fccde4184905efa2c60565a0e018)).
With first week, I had some very basic doubts and generalizing with final picture was not clear, but fortunately, my mentor
Marcel Stimberg was very knowledgebale and gave many insightful solutions to clear things!
