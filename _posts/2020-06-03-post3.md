Here comes the first week of Coding season!!
With all excitement, I started my work by writing a simple function that would get 
a ```NeuronGroup``` object and spit out a dictionary of basic details about it. The details
like name, population size were low hanging fruits but representing ```Equations``` and bringing in
structure was a bit involving. Moreover ```Equations``` is one of the most important entity in Brian.
Proceeding with next steps, other important details like, ```Events``` and ```identifiers``` are taken in
account ([Gist link for function](https://gist.github.com/Vigneswaran-Chandrasekaran/0b72fccde4184905efa2c60565a0e018)).

With first week, I had plethora of trivial and basic doubts and generalizing final picture was not clear, but fortunately, my mentor
Marcel Stimberg was very knowledgeable and gave many insightful solutions to clear things!
