| Minutes of Meeting<br>(Meeting date: 28 May,<br>2020) | - Complexities dealing with multiple networks<br><br>- Complexities dealing with multiple run()<br><br>- Handling build and device overriding run()<br><br>- Hierarchy of the standard dictionary format<br><br>- Entities to be present in the dictionary format for NeuronGroup<br><br>- Complexities dealing with Events like multiple statements for reset<br><br>- Organizing Events in the dictionary format<br><br>- Choosing a platform to work and push codes |
| Tasks | Implement a simple function to collect information from <br>NeuronGroup and return the details in dictionary format |
| Work done | Wrote a simple function: collect_NeuronGroup(group) that<br>returns all its properties in dict format |
| Problems facing/doubts | - In the key-value pair of the dictionary, should the<br>‘value’ be maintained as the BrianObject or convert to String<br><br>- Dimensionless is mentioned as radian by default,<br>should modify it?<br><br>- When spike events are defined, the equations are updated<br>with LastSpike and unless refractory parameters, should that<br>be included in the Equations key or only user-equations <br>are enough?<br><br>- Some flags like unless refractory/constant over dt are<br>not shown in flag variable |

The first week on Coding season and with all excitement, I started my work by writing a function
that would get a `NeuronGroup` object and spit out dictionary of basic details about it. The details
like name, population size were low hanging fruits to get but representing `Equations` and bringing in
structure was a bit involving and moreover it is one of the most important entity in Brian.
And proceeding with next steps, other important details like, `Events` and `identifiers` are taken in
account ([Gist link for function](https://gist.github.com/Vigneswaran-Chandrasekaran/0b72fccde4184905efa2c60565a0e018)).
With first week, I had some very basic doubts and generalizing with final picture was not clear, but fortunately, my mentor
Marcel Stimberg was very knowledgebale and gave many insightful solutions to clear things!
