title: Funning Science the Feynman's way

Prologue - A series on exciting hacks and lessons from Feynman's life

Richard P. Feynman, winner of Nobel Prize in 1965, is one of the world's exceptional theoretical physicists, and an
adventurous character. He had inspired countless people and revolutionized the whole notion of how Science should be pursued.
This series was intended to shed some light on the adventures by him and how they galvanize scientific enthusiasm to every science maniacs.
I got swooned over him, after reading the book on him, which goes by the name, "Surely you're joking, Mr.Feynman" where the jokes were
no longer funny but instead provoking. 

In his obituary `The New York Times` described him as,
<i> "arguably the most brilliant, iconoclastic and influential 
of the post-war generation of theoretical physicists" </i>

<i> "There are two types of genius. Ordinary geniuses do great things, but they leave you room 
to believe that you could do the same if only you worked hard enough. Then there are magicians,
you can have no idea how they do it. Feynman was a magician!" - Hans Bethe, Nobel laurete (theoretical physics) </i>
