With the beginning of the second month, we had a discussion on choosing the next possible step.
Possible next steps were: using `baseexport` to develop human readable `LaTeX`/`Markdown` export or
refactor current `nmlexport` package. And we decided to proceed with `NeuroML` exporter and worked on
thar for couple of weeks. The changes though were large but they were very straightforward because, 
in the previous package, the most part involved getting information from Brian objects. But now, with 
Baseexport's dictionary we only need to paste the required information to the `neuroml2/lems` template.
The previous version of the package was also well-documented and clear (thanks to the developer who was one of the
previous students of GSoC with Brian) and thus refactoring was an easy job.
