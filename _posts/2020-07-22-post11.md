Started working on `Synapses` similar to `NeuronGroup` as this also
derives from `Groups` class and has some similar things, like model equations. With Brian, `Synapses` is
the thing, that I don't anything about (also don't know much about real synapses in Brain). But the documentation for 
[Synapses in Brian docs](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/synapses.html) was really
helpful. To understand clearly how `Synapses` work, I took a clean white sheet and my machine and
worked on all the examples mentioned in the docs. That really helped to understand the `Synapses` and
helped to start working on that.
By end of the week, I would able to get done with half the work of `Synapses` and got a rough 
idea on remaining parts like `SynapticPathway`s and `Synapses.connect()`. In this period, I had lot of doubts and,
as usual got clarified and cleared things by no other than my mentor Marcel Stimberg.
