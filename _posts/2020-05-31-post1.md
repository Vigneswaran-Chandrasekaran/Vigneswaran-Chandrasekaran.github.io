During my junior year in Undergrad Computer Science, me and a small group of my friends had a talk 
about Google Summer of Code program and we eventually decided to give it a shot. When the mentoring 
organization list was out, we started exploring various open source organizations. By that time, I 
was more interested in Neuroscience stuffs although I don't know anything about it. So, I checked on 
the list and found `INCF` (International Neuroscience Coordinating Facility), which had bunch of 
sub-organizations to choose. I got pretty excited on seeing them but I wouldn't able to understand a 
pint from the project descriptions. That day, around 8 PM in night, I took my scooty and got a printout 
of all project ideas listed under INCF. After couple of days of checking, I messaged 
[Marcel Stimberg](https://github.com/mstimberg) about my interest and he was very helpful and encouraging. 
I worked on a [Pull Request](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/1069) to fix a small bug in `Network.run`'s 
`contained_objects`. That year, although I wouldn't able to make it, I was happy with my learning curve 
and keep making some minor contributions. This year, with a little edge in familiarity, I tried to fix 
some bugs that are assigned as a part of GSoC selection and created a 
[Pull Request](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2/pull/1176). And hurray! I got :partying_face: selected for 
this year GSoC with Brian team.
