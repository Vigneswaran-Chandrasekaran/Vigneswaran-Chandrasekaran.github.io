With this week, I was able to put in dictionary information and use them in LEMS device.
And I would able to get similar output as by the previous version!!

However, there were some technical difficulties to express features in Brian like
`run_regularly()`, particular member based initialization and other flexible ways
that make Brian very special but hard to find way to express them in `NeuroML` format.

At this level, I paused the refactoring `nmlexport` part and moved to conceptualizing
human readable export work, which is one of the prime goals of the project. And moreover,
a realtime validation to check the usability of the standard dictionary work done so far.

With the change in `nmlexport` package, there isn't any changes as previous version for user, because the user will
not be aware of all the backward changes done.
