title: Limitations, known bugs and missed targets
---

The project supports almost all Brian2 features and currently,
the unsupported ones are,

- Multi-compartmental Groups (SpatialNeuronGroup)
- Store/restore features
- Multi-network model (very rarely used)

Having "no bugs" is unavoidable and in fact that makes the work look more artificial ;)

Some known limitation(s) are,
- Comments in non `Equations` based string code (in `reset`, `prepost`, `run_regularly`, etc.)
are incorrectly identified as `identifiers` and fail in resolve to 


Although, I was able to cover almost all targets proposed in the proposal,
we missed creating fancy idea of finding out the "type of model" by evaluating
model dynamics and also missed integrating `baseexport` with `ModelDB` that was listed
in "Deliverables when time permits" section of proposal
