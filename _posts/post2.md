title: Community Bonding
---

During Community Bonding period, I was asked to check the relevant works
done previously in Brian as well as by others. Among which, `nmlexport` package 
is the most relevant to refer and familiarizing it was very crucial. The main
reason for that is my project proposal as well as `nmlexport` package has a lot of things and
intutions in common. As they both aim to describe Brian models in some standard representation.
I also looked at [ANNarchy](https://annarchy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) report feature
to represent models in [Nordlie et al. format](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000456).
(Notes taken during this period is available in 
[this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WHdmHx1JUAzHcSLYV31kWFedNPOPMJ_SDoZW-79b7c/edit?usp=sharing))

The most important thing to finalize within Community Bonding was exploring representation or markup language
to represent the proposed model descriptions. We checked `NeruoML Lite`, `XML`, `JSON` etc. based representation
and finally decided to use dictionary representation. The main intution was it is flexibile at the same time easy to
access and use as well. With this conceptualization and familiarization, I was set ready to start coding bammm!

The community bonding was really awesome, it helped me to get set and prepared to make my tiny contribution to be useful
to the organization. My mentor and I, also decided to keep Wednesday as the official weekly video meeting day apart from daily 
`Gitter` and Github conversations for doubt clarrifications and suggestions. And finally it indeed improved the quality of communication
between me and my mentors, and made to get to know about each other.
